# register_qemu_binfmt will mutate the underlying host system, which we don't want
#  to do without fair warning. In addition, on MacOS, this will either have no effect
#  on the DockerVM, as it's already configured that way, or it could possibly harm
#  the machine, if it was built with a different version of buildkit/qemu than what
#  this installs. If the setup has no effect, then the tests aren't actually useful.
#  In addition, testing the state of the DockerVM would require additional logic and
#  setup causing the local instances of the tests to differ from what would be run in
#  CI.  If it is desireable to run this particular test locally, it is recommended to
#  obtain a VM (ex: with Vagrant) and run this test suite with `RUN_DESTRUCTIVE_TESTS=true`
#  set in the environment.
