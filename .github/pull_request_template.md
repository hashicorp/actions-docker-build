### Summary

Freeform text to explain the change. Think about the potential reviewers
and what they need to know to perform a useful review.

### Justification

Please provide a **link** to a JIRA ticket, Slack thread, Google Doc,
or other relevant documentation about the aims of this PR. If they
don't exist, please state that.

### Quality

All code changes should be accompanied by relevant tests which
both document and protect the newly defined behavior. There are
_some_ exceptions like logging, configuration changes, and documentation updates.

This PR includes:

  - [ ] New or updated tests which validate the new behavior. _(Thank you!)_
  - [ ] New or updated behavior which has been manually tested. _(Please provide a link to relevant logs if this is the case.)_
  - [ ] New or updated behavior which is not testable in a reasonable time frame. _(Please ask for help if this is the case, more things are testable than we sometimes think!)_
  - [ ] No new or changed behavior _(Just documentation, configuration, or pure refactoring.)_
